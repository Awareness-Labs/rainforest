Rainforest Contributor Guide

Contributing
Do you want to contribute to Rainforest? Awesome! We’d love your help. To make it easier for you to contribute, we’ve provided some guidelines below to ensure that you (the contributor) know what we (the project maintainers) look for in terms of content as well as the criteria and procedures we use when reviewing your submissions.

A Word On Governance
Rainforest is governed by a small, dedicated and experienced team of maintainers. This team decides which contributions are accepted and included in releases, based largely on input and feedback from the community. In this role, our principal goal is to ensure that Rainforest adheres to its Design Goals while welcoming and facilitating broad contribution from the growing Rainforest user community.

When discussing GitHub procedures, we’ll use the term “committers” to refer to this group.

Rainforest Design Goals and Philosophy
Rainforest is designed with four goals in mind:

Performance - achieve the highest message throughput and lowest latency possible
Stability - Rainforest is “always on.” Nothing we put in Rainforest should cause it to crash, and Rainforest should guard itself against unruly client behavior that might compromise performance or availability for all clients.
Simplicity - a compact, simple, and easily mastered API that requires no knowledge about the implementation of the broker (Rainforest-server), and a broker that is lightweight, requiring minimal configuration, system resources and external dependencies.
Security - Rainforest supports basic security features: authentication, authorization and encryption (TLS)
