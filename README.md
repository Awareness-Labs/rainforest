3. **Ultra-lightweight Design**: Move away from cumbersome infrastructure and redundant features, and instead focus on efficiency and scalability.
4. **Compatibility with Multiple Data Sources**: Seamlessly integrate relational databases, NoSQL, data lakes, or data streams.
5. **Embedded with OLTP and OLAP Engines**: Utilizing the prowess of BadgerDB for persistent storage and DuckDB for analytical processing, Rainforest ensures swift and optimized query performance.

With Rainforest, transition your data infrastructure to a nimble, distributed, and high-performance data mesh model, prepping the ground for contemporary data requirements.
